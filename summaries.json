   "summaries": "Faculty Mentoring Program Expand All Introduction This mentoring program is intended to be a useful way of helping new faculty members adjust to their new environment.\nWhether it is academe itself that is new, or simply the UC San Diego campus, assistance from a well-respected mentor can be an invaluable supplement to the guidance and assistance that a Department Chair provides during the early years at a new university.\nThe program\u2019s success will depend on the new faculty members, their mentors and their department chairs all taking an active role in the acclimation process.\nFor faculty appointed as Associate Professor or Professor, assignment of a mentor is less critical, but highly encouraged, to serve as a means of acclimating the new faculty member to UC San Diego.\nThe Responsibility of the Mentor The mentor should contact the new faculty member in advance of his/her arrival at the University and then meet with the new faculty member on a regular basis over at least the first two years.\nThe mentor should provide informal advice to the new faculty member on aspects of teaching, research and committee work or be able to direct the new faculty member to appropriate other individuals.\nThere is no evaluation or assessment of the new faculty member on the part of the mentor, only supportive guidance and constructive feedback.\nThe Responsibility of the New Faculty Member The new faculty member should keep his/her mentor informed of any problems or concerns as they arise.\nWhen input is desired, new faculty should leave sufficient time in the grant proposal and paper submission process to allow his/her mentor the opportunity to review and critique drafts.\nThe Mentor The most important tasks of a good mentor are to help the new faculty member achieve excellence and to acclimate to UC San Diego.\nA good relationship with a supportive, active mentor has been shown to contribute significantly to a new faculty member\u2019s career development and satisfaction.\nQualities of a Good Mentor Accessibility \u2013 the mentor is encouraged to make time to be available to the new faculty member.\nNetworking \u2013 the mentor should be able to help the new faculty member establish a professional network.\nIndependence \u2013 the new faculty member\u2019s intellectual independence from the mentor must be carefully preserved and the mentor must avoid developing a competitive relationship with the new faculty member.\nBenefits for the mentor Satisfaction in assisting in the development of a colleague Ideas for and feedback about the mentor\u2019s own teaching / scholarship A network of colleagues who have passed through the program Retention of excellent faculty colleagues Enhancement of department quality Changing Mentors In cases of changing commitments, incompatibility, or where the relationship is not mutually fulfilling, either the new faculty member or mentor should seek confidential advice from his/her Chair.\nThe new faculty member, in any case, should be encouraged to seek out additional mentors as the need arises."

Since 1997, WPI has offered a New Faculty Mentoring Program in order to provide new faculty members with professional and social support.\nElements of WPI\u2019s Program New faculty are asked to complete an information form if they wish to participate in the one-on-one component of the mentoring program.\nThe Morgan Center will recruit an appropriate mentor(s), based on the objectives and preferences expressed by the new faculty member and with input from the individual's department head.\nThe formal mentoring relationship is anticipated to last for the first year of the new faculty member's appointment, but may be extended or terminated at the request of any member of the team.\nWPI's mentoring program also has a strong \"cohort\" component, with regular gatherings of new and early career faculty focused on particular themes or for open discussion.\nAll new faculty are invited to attend, regardless of whether they participate in the one-on-one component of the mentoring program.\nShould I ask for a mentor inside my department or outside?\nIn other departments, it may help to be formally paired with an inside-department mentor through this program.\nCan I have more than one mentor, one inside the department and one outside?\nIn many ways WPI is not a typical university; mentoring helps new faculty get acclimated."

   "summaries": "Report of the Faculty Mentoring Study The Provost's Advisory Committee on Mentoring and Community Building Summary of Findings  INTRODUCTION  In November 2000, the Office of the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs sponsored a retreat entitled, \u201cMentoring, Quality of Faculty Life and Community Building.\u201d Nearly 100 University of Michigan administrators attended the retreat, including deans, associate and assistant deans, and department chairs.\nThe committee was charged with the task of identifying strategies to improve support for faculty, improving awareness and understanding of mentoring, and surveying faculty and administrators regarding their experiences with and their needs for mentoring.\nThe purpose of this report is to examine the results of the faculty and administrator surveys and focus groups regarding their experiences with mentoring.\nFINDINGS AND INFERENCES  The findings and inferences outlined below are based on the Committee\u2019s analysis of the data from the surveys of both junior faculty and administrators, each of which was comprised of closed- and open-ended questions about the practices of and support for mentoring on campus.\nWhile both junior faculty and administrators believe mentoring is important, there is no consensus on what constitutes effective mentoring.\nThere is a disjunct between mentoring preferences of faculty and administrators: Junior faculty members prefer structured (formal) mentoring efforts, whereas administrators prefer less structured (informal) approaches.\nAdministrator perceptions According to administrators, mentoring benefits both junior faculty and senior faculty and departments as a whole (e.g., by increasing faculty collaboration and providing an incentive for recruiting).\nJunior faculty perceptions While junior faculty members are satisfied overall with the quality and frequency of the mentoring they receive, they would prefer that senior faculty members and administrators reach out to them more proactively.\nJunior faculty that want more mentoring would prefer that mentoring target their needs, particularly the practicalities of how to accomplish specific professional goals and meet department, discipline-specific and \fUniversity expectations, so that the mentoring \u201cdemystifies\u201d the process of becoming a successful and productive faculty member.\nSome junior faculty expressed frustration at receiving outdated, conflicting, or inaccurate advice from their mentors.\nSome find a discrepancy between the message they received as graduate students, to become independent scholars, and the message they receive as junior faculty members, to be mentored.\nSome junior faculty members are comfortable seeking mentoring outside their academic unit, but others who do not seek such mentoring may be at risk.\nStructural issues can influence mentoring Small departments may have too few senior faculty members to mentor junior colleagues.\nWhile these faculty may particularly need mentoring, they may have more difficulty receiving it.\nCommunication and training issues can influence mentoring The desire of junior faculty for increased mentoring may result from a communication problem, caused by units providing inadequate information about mentoring opportunities that are actually available.\nSome senior faculty members may be unprepared to provide good mentoring.\nSome junior faculty groups may have unique mentoring needs above and beyond the needs that typical mentoring addresses.\nUnits should not assume that junior faculty members know what type of mentoring they need.\nUnits should assume junior faculty members need guidance or assistance from the school, college, or department to identify mentors.\nSenior faculty don\u2019t necessarily know what type of mentoring junior faculty need or want.\nThe concept of formal one-on-one mentoring is an impractical approach to meeting junior faculty members\u2019 needs.\nAdministrators perceive more mentoring activities being available (to junior faculty) than do junior faculty.\nFaculty will generally need a combination of mentors from both within and outside the department.\nMentoring efforts can range from formal (e.g., scheduled meetings with the department chair, mentor assignments) to informal (e.g., academic and/or social events that give junior faculty members the chance to meet a variety of senior faculty members in a non-threatening environment).\nMentoring should address the specific needs of individual junior faculty members.\nAn effective approach to mentoring junior faculty is to focus on the process of becoming the best academics they can be, instead of focusing solely on achieving tenure.\n1.1.1 Methods  The Faculty Mentoring Committee decided to conduct two surveys: one to learn about administrators\u2019 perceptions of and experiences with mentoring and one to learn about junior faculty members\u2019 perceptions of and experiences with mentoring.\nThese faculty members hold academic leadership positions in departments that were identified by survey respondents (or were otherwise known) as being actively engaged with faculty mentoring.\nCURRENT STATE OF MENTORING, AS PERCEIVED BY FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS   2.1 Information on respondents/participants  Table 1 provides information about the survey respondents, including their positions and, for faculty, key demographics.\n2.2 Current state of mentoring on campus   2.2.1 Types of mentoring activities

____________________________________________________________ Note: * = p < .05, ** = p < .01, *** = p < .001     Administrators and faculty differ in their perceptions of what is formal and what is informal.\nWith the exception of orientation for junior faculty, on each item a markedly higher percentage of administrators perceived more mentoring activities taking place than did junior faculty.\nAdministrator respondents described a variety of additional mentoring activities for junior faculty related to teaching, such as junior and senior faculty co-teaching, release time for junior faculty from teaching, and a variety of other teaching opportunities.\nAdministrators also pointed to professional societies as an important source of mentoring for junior faculty.\nA handful of administrators listed additional activities that they support, such as mentoring junior faculty for administrative posts and helping them prepare for presentations outside the University.\nOne administrator noted that some of their faculty members (with joint academic appointments) also hold appointments in departments that provide formal mentoring.\nOverall, administrators who responded to the open-ended questions believe there are ample mentoring opportunities for junior faculty at the University and beyond.\n2.2.2 Current efforts to assess mentoring in departments/academic programs or schools/colleges  Administrators were asked to review a designated list of assessment data that their departments/academic programs or their schools/colleges might collect on the effectiveness of their faculty mentoring efforts and then to check all that apply.\nTable 4 : Types of assessment data collected on mentoring activities in units, as per administrators

and graduate student support.\n2.3.1 From whom do faculty receive mentoring?\nFaculty survey respondents were provided with a list of types of mentors and asked from which types of mentors they had

mentors based largely on professional, rather than on race/ethnicity criteria.\nThe largest percentage of administrators identified similar research interests (76%), interpersonal compatibility (70%), and teaching effectiveness (63%) as the three criteria they use most when selecting faculty mentors.\nVery few administrators (14%) selected race/ethnicity as a criterion their units use to select faculty mentors.\nAdministrators were invited to identity other criteria their units consider and were also asked to explain which criteria for selecting faculty mentors they believe to be very or critically important.\nIn the open-ended responses, administrators cited a long list of qualities that they believe are very or critically important in selecting faculty mentors, foremost among them the interpersonal compatibility of the mentor and mentee.\nAdministrators assigned equal importance to the need for the faculty mentors to share research and scholarly interests with their mentees.\n2.4 Attitudes toward mentoring activities  2.4.1 Frequency of/ Satisfaction with mentoring, as reported by faculty Table 9 below summarizes responses to a question about how often the faculty members have interacted with their mentors, sorted by demographics.\nTable 9 : Frequency of faculty interaction with mentors  ____________________________________________________________  \f

____________________________________________________________  The frequency of mentoring interactions was variable, and was higher among males and whites.\nTable 10 below summarizes responses to a question about how satisfied the faculty respondents were with the mentoring they have received and with how often they have interacted with their mentors.\nTable 10 : Satisfaction with frequency and quality of mentoring contacts  ____________________________________________________________     Frequency of Contact  Quality of Contact   (% responding yes)  (% responding yes)           Total  73.0

 ____________________________________________________________  While satisfaction with mentoring was generally high, women, international faculty and minorities were less satisfied with the frequency of interactions, and international faculty were least satisfied overall.\nOpen-Ended Responses     The survey also posed two follow-up (open-ended) questions to faculty respondents:  [If you are not satisfied with how often you interact with your mentor(s)], how much contact would you like to have?\nOn the whole, the faculty respondents\u2019 open-ended responses consistently reflected their need for regular contact with mentors.\n2.4.2 Levels of mentoring support  The surveys presented junior faculty and administrators with a series of common academic tasks that faculty perform.\nFor each task, faculty respondents were asked to indicate what level of mentoring support they would like to receive, whereas administrators were asked to report the level of mentoring and support they believe their units provide to junior faculty.\n174 \f 1.82  0.77  67  2.19  0.56  0.000  Using teaching resources-dept  180  1.77  0.67  62  1.81  0.72     Making contacts-industry  174  1.75  0.76  58  1.55

administrators agreed that junior faculty need mentoring and support with becoming integrated into the UM culture, but faculty respondents wanted more mentoring and support than the administrators said their academic units provide.\nAdministrators and junior faculty agree on only a subset of activities as proper topics for mentoring.\nJunior faculty and administrators also agreed that junior faculty need mentoring for preparing performance reports, using departmental teaching resources, and balancing work and family.\nJunior faculty were much more likely than administrators to want mentoring on how to connect to professional associations, become socially integrated, serve as role models, serve on committees, and supervise research assistants.\nThe administrators provided a small number of open-ended responses to this question, but those who did commented only on the role mentoring plays in helping both faculty members and departments to succeed.\n2.4.4 Administrators\u2019 perception of unique mentoring needs  Administrators were asked whether women and faculty of color have special mentoring needs.\nTable 13 : Administrator perceptions of unique mentoring needs for

and administrators concur that time is a significant barrier to mentoring, but they disagree on the importance of organizational structure and resources.\nHigh percentages of both junior faculty (58%) and administrators (56%) identified a lack of faculty time as the most formidable barrier to mentoring.\nWhereas 23% of junior faculty identified institutional organization as a barrier to mentoring, only 5% of administrators selected this item as a barrier.\nSimilarly, 32% of junior faculty cited insufficient resources as an impediment to mentoring as compared to 15% of the administrators."

   "summaries": "Top Ten Things New Faculty Members Would like to Hear from Colleagues Mary Deane Sorcinelli - University of Massachusetts When we seasoned faculty look back at the early years of our careers in academia, what advice do we wish we had received as we started out?\nMore than a decade of research has identified three core, consistent and interwoven concerns that affect early career faculty as they navigate their way through the first years.\nNew faculty want:  a more comprehensible tenure system a stronger sense of community, and a balanced and integrated life Studies also show that senior colleagues and department chairs can play an important role in creating the kind of academic environment that supports the success of early career faculty (Rice, Sorcinelli & Austin, 2000; Sorcinelli, 2000).\nAs an antidote to the triple threat of evaluation, isolation, and overwork, I'd like to offer some advice drawn not only from research on what helps new faculty succeed, but also from my interactions with hundreds of new and early career faculty members, their mentors, and their chairs.\nThe following are the top ten things I believe new faculty members would most like to hear from their chair (or senior colleagues) as they try to figure out how to live an academic life-that is, how to teach well, produce fruitful research, earn tenure, pay attention to a partner and children, lead an examined life, and make plans for the future  Getting Started 1.\nNewcomers, with new energy and ideas, help us improve our department.\nDespite your greatness, however, you aren't expected to figure out everything about this department and institution on your own.\nI'm sure there are one or two new faculty members who may appear to manage it all in their first year, but in my experience, such an expectation is unrealistic.\nFigure out what matters Every department and college differs in its expectations for research, teaching and service.\nTalk to your department chair and to the dean, but remember that what we say may be constrained by pressures bearing on us at the moment.\nTalk to recently tenured faculty and talk to that respected, older, straight shooting professor who can give you solid, realistic advice.\nBetter yet, along the way, try to sit on the department personnel committee so that you can measure the official version of how things happen against what happens in practice.\nFinally, make an appointment to meet with the department chair at least once a year to review those manageable goals we walked about earlier as well as your teaching and research, your annual faculty report, and the tenure timetable.\nBut you're not going to help your career development if you are working hard on something that does not matter.\nFor example, we all want and need you to be a good department and campus citizen.\nSomeone might relish your chairing the department space or website committee, but let's talk about how you can make the best investments in terms of citizenship in your early years.\nBut teaching, especially a commitment to undergraduate students, increasingly matters a lot in most departments.\nWe know that early career faculty find great satisfaction in being valued as a teacher and advisor by students.\nWe, your senior colleagues, are here to help you figure out where your teaching is going and why you are taking it there.\nSomeone in the teaching and learning center or your dean or your department chair can introduce you to teachers in and outside of our department who are committed to teaching and student learning.\nPut simply, departments can't afford faculty who can't teach their way out of a paper bag.\nWe'll be talking about and assessing teaching and student learning all along the way with you.\nCultivate a specialty that you enjoy and do well (e.g., large classes, junior year writing) as it will make your teaching more coherent and enjoyable.\nHow are you helping to define and complement the department's avowed teaching and research mission?\nHow will your work help to enhance the department?\nFinally, try not to avoid or procrastinate on the important tasks in your plan-on the things that matter.\nI'll introduce you to one or two senior faculty members in the department who have volunteered to meet with you on an ongoing basis.\nMentors inside the department can help you with issues of teaching and scholarship and also on how to read the culture-who's who, what visions people have.\nAgain, I also encourage you to reach out to colleagues beyond the department.\nIf you share a sense of excitement about your teaching and scholarship, it will bring colleagues to you who can contribute to your work.\nThis is a place where we meet to share works in progress, to talk about our teaching and our students, and to socialize.\nReach outside of the department as well-for example, once again, to our teaching and learning center, our scholarly writing group for junior faculty, or our community-service learning initiatives.\nThe good news is that as a new faculty member, you'll probably get better at juggling multiple roles and tasks.\nSomething I did in my early career was to pick one thing that mattered out of all the responsibilities and tasks I'd outlined.\nOnce that one thing went \"out the door,\" be it developing a new course or writing a book chapter, I turned to the next thing that mattered, so there was always one project getting a good chunk of my time.\nIt didn't always work, but it was helpful to hold as an ideal plan.\nIf you are drained, you can't be imaginative in the ways your teaching and research require.\nThere is no doubt from studies of new faculty that despite our best personal efforts, systemic problems remain that prevent faculty, departments, and institutions from being the best that they can be, especially in the pursuit of excellence in teaching and student learning.\nWhat is meaningful faculty work to you?"
